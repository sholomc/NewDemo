		The Program Office wants to develop a new Situational Awareness Control System (SACS) component for a platform currently in the fleet. The SACS will provide real-time Situational Awareness (SA) capabilities to the cockpit.  These capabilities take in data from on-board sensors (e.g., RF Interferometer) to support situational awareness as required by a number of on-board systems (e.g., Multifunctional Display). SA data is exchanged through communications systems on board, with other aircraft, and with the ground.
